## v0.8.0 - 2023-11-07

This release adds new syntax:

```markdown
- ![Title](file.md)
```

Use this form inside a summary file to recursively include
the contents of another summary file under the given title.

### Added
- Add -unsafe flag to reference files outside the current directory.
- Summary files now support including other summary files with the syntax `![Title](file.md)`.

### Changed
- Paths to files in error messages are relative to the input directory.
